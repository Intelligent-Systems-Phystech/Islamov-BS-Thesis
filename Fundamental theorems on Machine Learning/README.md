# Fundamental Theorems on Machine Learning

This folder contains information about the course `Fundamental Theorems on Machine Learning`. We need to make a report on two topics which are close to our Bachelor thesis. The goal of this course is to learn how we should construct theorems in our Bachelor thesis correctly and clearly to readers.  The first report should be based on the literature which we use in the thesis. The second report should be exactly from the main paper (thesis).
